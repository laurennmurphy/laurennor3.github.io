      Do you know your Gregorc Thinking Style? The Gregoric Thinking style analyzes how the mind works. According to this <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">quiz</a>, my learning style is "Concrete Random." As a Concrete Random thinker, I love to experiment and take risks. I enjoy taking on projects I'm unfamiliar with, researching them, and solving them independently. I think my learning style will help me at DBC because learning to coding is about getting comfortable with being uncomfortable. There will always be something I don't understand that may need to be resolved through a trial and error approach but that does not mean I'm not learning. Though my thinking style is more independently driven, I believe my DBC experience will continue to help me grow because of the emphasis on pair-programming. So far, I've enjoyed pair-programming because it's been fun exchanging ideas and knowledge about how to approach certain challenges.

       So far my biggest struggle in Phase 0 has been getting used to having a publish unfinished web site. Though this may seem unusual, the navigation bar not having fully functional links makes me feel uneasy. I think this may be related to my learning style because according to information I've read about Concrete Random thinkers, they are competitive especially with themselves. When I was kid, I used to create fansites about my favorite shows or movies for fun. However, there was a bit of a competitve nature with others to produce the best design and not publish the site until it's finished. My main strategy has been to remind myself to relax and have fun with this because while it may be a work-in-progress having live is a positive. It allows me to get feedback from others that may be useful for the design. It also allows people to see my passion for the project expressed through code and will tell a story about the journey I've taken to complete it.

        Looking back on fixed vs growth mindsets, I believe it is difficult to learn without a level of vulnerability. A fixed mindset focuses on a desire to always appear as though you have all the answers and avoid situations where you don't. Having a growth mindset means that you consider learning to be a process containing challenges and obstacles. I believe that being enrolled in DBC continues to help me broaden on how I learn. As a student in a cohort, the curiculum requires that we check in with our accountability groups and ask for help from our peers. Learning to code with others is just as important as learning to code on your own.
