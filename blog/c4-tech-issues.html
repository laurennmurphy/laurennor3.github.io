      Recently, the retention rate of women in tech is an topic that is frequently in the news. I think that acknowledging that despite this being a problem across industries discussions about this issue are as important as steps being taken to resolve it. While there have been a few initiatives by some tech companies to hire more women, closing the gender gap also means creating a company culture that is inclusive in order to help decrease the retention rate of mid-career employees.

      As a web development student, this is an topic that has become very important to me. I'm a member of a few tech and leadership groups such as <a href="http://www.meetup.com/wimlink/">Wimlink</a>, <a href="http://www.geekettes.io/">Geekettes</a>, and <a href="https://www.womenwhocode.com/">Women Who Code</a>. These groups have helped me connect with other women interested in working in tech as well as others already working in tech industry. Some of the women, I met through these groups also inspired me to make a career change. I'm currently a volunteer for The Sally Conference coming up on July 25th. The Sally Conference is a joint project by BLOOM Behavior and Women Who Code NYC to provide women with tools to plan for career advancement. This has been an enriching experience so far and I can't wait until the conference!
