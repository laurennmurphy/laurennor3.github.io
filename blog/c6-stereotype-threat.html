      Stereotype threat is the feeling you're confirming some group-based limitation. It is important to note that this something that can affect any race, genders, ethnicities, or ages. Sometimes when you look around the room and you fell as though you're the only one from a certain age group or gender it causes anxiousness. For instance, if you're a woman, you may face some anxiety about performing well in math and sciences because past studies and societal norms try to imply that men are naturally able to perform better in these subjects.According to a Columbia lecture by "" about Stereotype threat, how much you care about proving otherwise could end up undermining your performance because you're trying too hard and not focusing on what you know.

      When I was a kid, I experienced situations like this as an African-American girl in the U.S.. At an early age, you notice and may wonder why you don't see people who look like you in a classroom or occupation. Sometimes it's difficult to push through these things that you become more and more aware of as your grow up especially when it is brought to your attention or you're singled out because of it. However, I've learned that it is important to try to not let these things prevent you from pursuing the things you are really passionate about in life.
