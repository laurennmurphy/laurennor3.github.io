##Variable Scope##

###Week 6 of DBC's Remote Prepwork###

###07/26/2015##

This week we learned more about Ruby variable scopes. In this programming language, there are five variable scopes--global, instance, class, local and constants. Each variable is distinguishable by certain characteristics detailed below.

- CONSTANT variables - always capitalized; usually unchanged
- $Global variables - marked by this symbol '$';the top level in the variable hierarchy
- @instance variables - marked by this symbol '@'
- @@class variables - marked by this symbol '@@'; a strict level in the variable hierachy
- local_variable - usually lowercase without any symbols in front of them; local variable
