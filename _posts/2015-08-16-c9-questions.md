##Asking Good Questions##

###Week 9 of DBC's Remote Prepwork###

###08/16/2015###

Prior to my enrollment in Dev Bootcamp, I formed a bit of a bond with members of [Code Newbies](http://www.codenewbie.org/) through Twitter. It's an online community for people learning to code. The organizers have a Twitter Chat every Wednesday evening and always emphasize it being a space for people to ask anything without being judged. As a result, I've been a member of their Slack channel and did not feel any nervous energy about asking questions in their channel. I have not been in a situation as of late where I posted a question to a community and did not get a helpful response.However, I do think that when asking code questions I need to work on expressing my thoughts in more detail. I believe I will only improve over time.

Recently, I asked the Code Newbies Slack channel for advice and or resources they found useful when they implemented a Jekyll blog. Though I did receive responses with two useful links, I found that it still took me some time to conceptualize how Jekyll works. The members who responded did say I could message them if I had any more questions but I still wasn't sure what to ask. It is certainly easy for me to get carried away in the research so I decided to start playing around with Jekyll to become more familiar with what it was doing. Soon, I had a more specific question about the role of the "_site" folder in Jekyll. It turned out that the response received about what this folder was doing was the missing piece in demystifying how it worked. There was my "aha!" moment and it was thanks to not being afraid to ask a follow-up question. Afterward, I was confident my content was being compiled correctly I was able to push it to github.
