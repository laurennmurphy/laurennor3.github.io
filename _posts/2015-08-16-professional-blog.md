##More Jekyll Than Hyde##

###Week 9 of DBC's Remote Prepwork###

###08/16/2015##

Even though I was planning to blog about my Phase 0 experience at Dev Bootcamp, I've found that I only blogged when it was mandatory. However, I plan to work toward doing at post at least once a week when I go on-site. I start Phase 1 of Dev Bootcamp tomorrow! I'm very excited but still feel some nervous energy about it. This week is my final week of remote prepwork. One of our challenges was to revisit our github.io site.

While my site has maintained it's look throughout the program, one of the things I decided to do was implement Jekyll. Jekyll is a static blog framework. Prior to my enrollment, in DBC I was planning to create a blog using it so this was a great opportunity to try it out.

In a lot of ways, Jekyll could be considered the answer for people trying to minimize the amount of HTML and CSS they would need to use to add content to their site. Jekyll has allowed me to apply the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) aspect to my code. In fact, the beauty of this framework is how powerful the less is more approach is. Instead of having to apply CSS links and HTML code to every page you create, it allows you to store the information in "includes" and "layouts" folders.

One of the trickier things about Jekyll was understanding how it compilies my site content. It took some trial and error but I'm happy with the overall design. Now, I can write my blog posts without having to worry about HTML and CSS coding. With this in mind, I would say the structure of my site has become more Jekyll than Hyde.
