##From Java to Ruby##

###09/15/2015##

Whenever I applied to a coding school, one of the 2-year goals I always listed was to create an Android app. This may have seemed bizarre on a web development application but it was the truth. Since I got my first Android
mobile device in 2011, I've been attached to the platform. Since I knew I would have to learn Java and Android to accomplish this goal, the idea of starting off with mobile development seemed rather daunting as someone new to coding. Also, most of the research I did regarding what programming language I should choose as a beginner led me to Ruby. However, thinking back, I never had a strong endgame case for Ruby. Perhaps this was why I felt it was okay to make a change.

Even though I enrolled in Dev Bootcamp with aspirations to become a web developer, I left the program early because it did not feel like the best fit for me. I have no regrets about the time I spent there. I met amazing people through it and the school's prep-work did help me get over some of my programming fears. Who knew I head straight to Java.

I found another coding school called TurnToTech that taught Ruby-on-Rails, iOS, and Android. Though my plan was to initially pick up where I left off at Dev Bootcamp, I found out that the school recently switched to only doing mobile. I was invited to come in and check the school out. After talking to the school and alum, it seemed like it would be a good place to study Android development if I wanted to make that switch. I didn't make the decision immediately. I went online to check out Java resources. I started with a Java for Complete Beginner's course by John Purcell(which I highly recommend!). I also installed Eclipse on my computer and gave it a try. Java no longer seemed as intimidating as it once did when I first saw the syntax. This is why I think that Ruby and JavaScript helped me work on my confidence level. When I looked at the language and started doing coding exercises, I said "I can learn this." Of course, Java would only be the beginning of my Android journey but I was starting off with the right mentality.
