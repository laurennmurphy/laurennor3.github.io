###Week 1 of DBC's Remote Prepwork###

###06/14/2015###

This week we watched the Shereef's Fireside Chat video. It was an interesting video. Shereef Bishay is one of the co-founders of Dev Bootcamp. In his video, he talks about the two different mindsets of people who enroll in a coding bootcamp--restaurant and kitchen. The restaurant mindset is synonymous with the consumers who enroll in a school and only expect to get their money's worth. He described the kitchen mindset as one of the creators who wants to create a mess or be a part of a group creating a stew without a recipe. During enrollment at DBC, he wants us to take control of our own education in order to develop a hacker attitude.

*Based on the video, what's your take on the DBC experience?*
I think it's about being a part of the community. Even though we have paid for an educate, we must not lose sight of the fact that connections matter just as much if not more. It not only about growing as a developer but also as a human being. I suspect this is why DBC cohorts have unique names.

*What is your impression of DBC?*
When I first visited DBC, I got the feeling that it had a strong community of students, alumni, instructors, and staff. It's also a school that cares about students' emotional well-being throughout their progression in the program.

*How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?*
I believe it's a type of culture I will feel comfortable engaging in. I did a lot of research on coding schools
prior to my enrollment and there were very few schools I could see myself at.

*Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how?*
No, my expectations of DBC have not changed. I still believe I made the right decision to enroll to the experience.

*Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?*
I'm excited but also nervous.
