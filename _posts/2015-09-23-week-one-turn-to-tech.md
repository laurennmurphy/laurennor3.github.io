##Studying at TurnToTech##

###09/23/2015##

I thought about doing a post every week but then realized that I probably won't have something to say about this school every week. I'm going to mix things up with some posts about tech event I've attended too.

Starting out with Algorithms in Java absolutely made me want to pull my hair out but it was exutiatingly necessary. I was absolutely shocked that I was handed this material on my first week and was glad I did some work with Java and Eclipse on my own prior to enrollment because I think if I never coded anything in Java or had zero knowledge of Eclipse that would have added to the level of difficulty. One of the things about this program is that it's self-study alongside the curriculum because they're not going to teach you everything. It's also really up to you to speak up if you're completely lost on something. However, at the same time, they're not going to feed you the answers. By the end of the Algorithms sheet, there wasn't a document I wanted to set on fire so badly in my life. It took me a while to get through it but I felt I accomplished a lot by the end of it. Learning to code is marathon not a sprint. I gave myself time to mull over the problems before asking for help. This is a learning environment I can give myself time work through my problem solving skills since I'm learning to think like a programmer.
