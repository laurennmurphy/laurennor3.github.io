##From Ruby to Java##

##09/13/2015##

Okay, now some of you may be wondering how this occurred. Truthfully, I've always wanted to build an Android application but Java seemed intimidating when I first looked at it. When you do a Google search of programming languages for beginners, Ruby is often at the top of the list. Ruby feels magical at time. Ruby documentation was beginner friendly(Yep, I realize this now after diving into Java.) There was also a built-in method for nearly everything and unless I was in a situation that required me not to use one I relied on them heavily. The first thing I noticed right off the back was that Java did not have the level of simplicity of Ruby. Simple tasks such as printing out a line of code were lengthy in comparison to Ruby. Java is more robust and requires more typing. Even though I'm not crazy about IDEs(Integrated Development Environment), Eclipse and I quickly became friends.

I highly recommend John Purcell's Intro to Java Programming course on Udemy. He does an excellent job explaining useful Eclipse tips while going over Java fundamentals.
